A command line `.http` file toolkit

> [!WARNING]
> **Zap is in early development and is not yet ready for use**

![caution](./docs/img/caution.png)

## Project Description

`zap` is a command line toolkit to work with, execute, and run API tests using `.http` files. See any of the following guides for an overview of the `.http` file syntax:

- [JetBrains HTTP Request in Editor Spec]
- [JetBrains Syntax Guide]
- [VSCode REST Extension]

```http
// Comments can begin with slashes '/' or hashes '#' and last until the next newline character '\n'
# This is also a comment (I'll use '/' from now on but you are free to use both)

// Global variables (e.g. base url) can be defined with '@ident = <value>'
@base = https://api.company.com

// 3 '#' in a row mark a new HTTP request, with an optional comment e.g. "Deletes employee 1"
// This comment is effectively the description of the request
### [comment]
HTTP_METHOD <url>
Header-Name: <header value>

// You can also give them names like this, although names like this
// do not allow spaces e.g. 'Delete employee 1' must be 'DeleteEmployee1'
###
# @name <name>
# @name=<name>
# @name = <name>
HTTP_METHOD <url>
...

// Global variables are interpolated like this
### Get employee 1
GET {{ base }}/employees/1

// Pass the body of requests like this
### Update employee 1 name
PATCH {{ base }}/employees/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Namey McNamerson"
}
```

## Installation

Compiled binaries for all supported platforms can be found in the [GitHub release]. There is also a [homebrew] tap:

```shell
brew install --cask FollowTheProcess/tap/zap
```

## Quickstart

Given a `.http` file containing 1 or more http requests like this:

```http
// demo.http

@base = https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

### Simple demo request
# @name Demo
GET {{ base }}/todos/1
Accept: application/json
```

You can invoke any one of them, like this...

```shell
# zap do [file] [request name]
zap do ./demo.http Demo
```

## Compatibility

While there is a strict specification for the format of pure HTTP requests ([RFC9110]). There is little/no formal specification for the evolution of the format used in this project, the
closest things available are:

- [JetBrains HTTP Request in Editor Spec]
- [JetBrains Syntax Guide]
- [VSCode REST Extension]

And careful inspection of them reveals a number of discrepancies and inconsistencies between them. As a result, knowing which features/syntax to support for this project
was... tricky. So this project is a best effort to support the syntax and features that I thought was most reasonable and achievable in a standalone command line tool
not built into an IDE.

Some of the more prominent differences are:

### Whitespace

The [JetBrains HTTP Request in Editor Spec] specifies exact whitespace requirements between different sections e.g. a single `\n` character *must* follow a request line.

See <https://github.com/JetBrains/http-request-in-editor-spec/blob/master/spec.md#23-whitespaces>

This project makes no such requirement, whitespace is entirely ignored meaning the formatting of `.http` files is up to convention and/or automatic formatting tools

### Response Handlers

The [JetBrains HTTP Request in Editor Spec] allows for custom JavaScript [Response Handlers](https://github.com/JetBrains/http-request-in-editor-spec/blob/master/spec.md#324-response-handler) (e.g. the `{% ... %}` blocks), that take the response and transform it in some way:

```plaintext
GET http://example.com/auth

> {% client.global.set("auth", response.body.token); %}
```

This is not supported in `zap` as it relies on editor-specific context and requires a JavaScript runtime.

However, the version of this syntax where you dump the response body to a file *is* supported!

```plaintext
GET http://example.com/auth

> ./response.json
```

### Response Reference

The [JetBrains HTTP Request in Editor Spec] allows for a [Response Reference], but doesn't actually explain what that is or what should be done with it? So I've left it out for now ü§∑üèª

```plaintext
GET http://example.com

<> previous-response.200.json
```

> [!NOTE]
> I can foresee a potential use for this syntax: Saving the first response to the filepath indicated and then the next time it runs, comparing the responses and generating a diff of
> the previous response vs the current one. This isn't implemented yet but it's in the back of my mind for the future üëÄ
